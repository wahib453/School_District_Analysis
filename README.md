## Summary Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
The four major changes that may be obsereved include:
(1) Average reading score
(2) Percent passing math
(3) Percent passing reading
(4) Percent overall passing
However, from overall perspective, these changes have minimal or no significance. Moreover, from individual perspective, these major changes can result to either a student passing or failing the class. or possibly retaking the tests.
